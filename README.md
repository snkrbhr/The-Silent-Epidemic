## About
"The Silent Epidemic" is a focused static website built with HTML to inform, educate, and provide resources related to a health / social topic. The content should be easy to edit and deploy so contributors can update guidance and resources quickly.

## Features
- Fully static HTML site (no backend required)
- Accessible semantic HTML structure
- Simple, easy-to-edit pages and assets
- Ready for hosting on GitHub Pages or any static host

## Tech stack
- HTML (100%)
- Optional: add CSS and JavaScript files if you want styling or interactivity

## Preview / Live demo
No official live demo configured in the repo yet.

You can quickly preview locally (see below) or deploy to GitHub Pages for a live site.

## Getting started (local)
To view the site locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/snkrbhr/The-Silent-Epidemic.git
2. Open the main HTML file in your browser:
   - Open `index.html` (or the appropriate top-level HTML file) in your browser.
3. If you prefer a local server (recommended for relative paths):
   - Python 3: run `python -m http.server` in the repo folder and visit http://localhost:8000

## Development workflow
- Edit or add `.html` files directly.
- If you add styling, include CSS files in a `css/` folder and link them from your HTML.
- If you add scripts, include JS files in a `js/` folder and link them from your HTML.
- Keep content accessible using semantic tags and proper alt text for images.

Suggested tooling:
- Code editor: VS Code, Sublime, Atom
- Linter (optional): HTMLHint / Prettier for consistent formatting

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
1. Push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings on GitHub: Settings → Pages → Source → select `main` branch and `/ (root)`.
3. Save — GitHub will publish the site at `https://snkrbhr.github.io/The-Silent-Epidemic/` (may take a few minutes).

Alternatively use any static host (Netlify, Vercel, Surge) — point them to this repo or upload the compiled site.

Contributions are welcome! Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`
